                        <p>
                            For this project, I worked with a local music producer 
                            named MellowStruck. He wanted a clean, geometric, black 
                            and white logo to use throughout his album covers, social 
                            media posts, and other branded content. The main goal was 
                            to combine the letters “M” and “S” into a logo that felt 
                            true to his style — a mix of energetic EDM  and calming 
                            Lofi soundscapes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To bring this vision to life, I researched logos from 
                            successful EDM and Lofi artists to see which visual styles 
                            were popular. It was clear that using clean geometric 
                            shapes to combine his “M” and “S” into a single logo was 
                            the right direction.
                        </p>

                        <h2>02</h2>
                        <h1>&nbsp;IDEATION</h1>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text-block-ruler"></div>
                    <div class="text-block-copy">
                        <p>
                            Starting with the logo, I broke down the letters “M” and 
                            “S” into simple geometric forms. After several iterations, 
                            I landed on versions of each letter that shared an identical 
                            central shape. From there, it took little effort to overlay 
                            the letters and create the final logo design.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the wordmark, I followed a similar process. My goal 
                            was to design “Mellow” and “Struck” so they worked well 
                            both side by side and stacked vertically. I began with 
                            bold, blocky letters, then extended the foot of the “L” 
                            to create an underline that kept the stacked version 
                            balanced.

                            I'm really proud of the logo and wordmark design. The 
                            geometric shapes and blocky letters fit well with typical 
                            EDM branding, while the softer, rounded corners give it a 
                            playful feel that reflects MellowStruck's lighter lofi 
                            soundscapes. Keeping it black and white makes the design 
                            versatile across different uses.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            MellowStruck was very happy with the designs and has used 
                            them across his album covers, social media, and YouTube 
                            channels. As a repeat client, he also asked me to create 
                            album artwork and design his portfolio website, noting 
                            that he appreciates my clear communication and creative 
                            solutions.
