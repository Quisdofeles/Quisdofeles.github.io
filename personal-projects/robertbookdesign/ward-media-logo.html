                        I worked with Hunter Ward, a freelance film producer, to
                        create a bold brand mark for his social media, website,
                        and invoices. The main goal was to design a cinematic
                        logo that felt true to his career in videography while
                        remaining clean and legible across all digital and
                        print platforms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        To bring this to life, I researched modern media
                        companies to find a style that balanced a professional
                        look with a creative edge. Using heavy typography and
                        his signature colors was the best way to ensure the
                        identity stayed sharp on everything from high-res
                        headers to small website icons.

                    src="images/Ward Media_Ideation.webp" 
                    alt="Sketchs and test drawings for Mellowstruck's logo and wordmark.">
                </div>
                <div class="text-block">
                    <div class="text-block-titles">
                        <h2>02</h2>
                        <h1>&nbsp;IDEATION</h1>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text-block-ruler"></div>
                    <div class="text-block-copy">
                        <p>
                        I started the process by designing a custom clapperboard
                        icon, a classic symbol that immediately signals film and
                        videography. I refined the clapper top into a clean form
                        that sits perfectly above the brand name. From there,
                        I stacked the text elements to serve as the base,
                        creating a unified and clever visual mark.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        By using the typography itself to build the body of
                        the clapper, I kept the final design compact and
                        memorable. This ensures the logo stays recognizable
                        as a film brand while remaining clean enough for
                        everything from social media profile pictures to
                        professional invoices.
                        </p>

            <!--Solution-->
            <div id="project-solution" class="project-solution" data-label="SOLUTION" data-parent="project-page">
                <div class="image-block">
                    <img 
                    src="images/Ward Media_Solution.webp" 
                    alt="Final poster designs and mockups.">
                </div>
                <div class="text-block">
                    <div class="text-block-titles">
                        <h2>03</h2>
                        <h1>&nbsp;SOLUTION</h1>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text-block-ruler"></div>
                    <div class="text-block-copy">
                        <p>
                        The final logo and wordmark turned out great. The
                        clapperboard concept and bold typography fit perfectly
                        with modern film branding, while the clean vector lines
                        ensure the mark stays sharp across any medium. Keeping
                        the design scalable makes it easy to apply to
                        everything from gear cases to digital watermarks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Ward Media has already integrated the logo across
                        his social media and as a clean watermark for his
                        video projects. He was glad to finally have a
                        high-res brand kit that works seamlessly as an intro
                        graphic and a professional stamp on his invoices,
                        giving him a cohesive look across all platforms.
                        </p>
