                            Some time after designing his logo, MellowStruck reached 
                            out again for help with a portfolio website. He needed a 
                            place where he could introduce himself, showcase his music, 
                            and direct users to his social platforms. The goal was to 
                            create a site that felt professional and effective at 
                            presenting his work, while still staying true to his brand 
                            identity and values.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            MellowStruck specifically wanted to feature several of his 
                            portrait photographs throughout the site. After reviewing 
                            other producers' portfolio websites, we agreed that a 
                            simple dark theme would make those detailed, colorful 
                            images pop without losing readability.

                            I started by sketching multiple ideas for each section 
                            and combining  them until the layout felt right. Once the 
                            structure was clear, I created wireframes to refine the 
                            design. With the framework in place, I added images, 
                            colors, and typography before coding the site in HTML and 
                            CSS.

                        <p>
                            The main design challenge was balancing a professional 
                            layout with his detailed photographs. The solution was to 
                            apply subtle vignettes to background images and separate 
                            sections with monochromatic content blocks, creating a 
                            layered effect that is visually interesting while 
                            maintaining an intuitive user experience.

                            The finished project is a four-page, fully responsive 
                            website designed for laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. 
                            It highlights my understanding of color theory, thoughtful 
                            font pairing, intuitive UI/UX decisions, and practical

                            platform for showcasing his music and connecting with new 
                            clients. Its clean layout makes it easy to explore his 
                            tracks, learn about his work, and access his social links. 
                            He actively uses it as his central hub for collaborators, 
                            listeners, and industry contacts.
