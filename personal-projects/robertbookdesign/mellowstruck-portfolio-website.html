                            Some time after designing his logo, MellowStruck reached 
                            out again for help with a portfolio website. He needed a
                            place where he could introduce himself, showcase his 
                            music, and direct users to his social platforms. The 
                            goal was to create a site that felt professional and 
                            effective at presenting his work, while still staying 
                            true to his brand identity and values.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            MellowStruck specifically wanted to feature several of 
                            his portrait photographs throughout the site. After 
                            reviewing other producers' portfolio websites, we 
                            agreed that a simple dark theme would make those 
                            detailed, colorful images pop without losing readability.

                            I started by sketching multiple ideas for each 
                            section and combining them until the layout felt right. 
                            Once the structure was clear, I created wireframes 
                            to refine the design. With the framework in place, 
                            I added images, colors, and typography before coding 
                            the site in HTML and CSS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The main design challenge was balancing a 
                            professional layout with his detailed photographs. 
                            The solution was to apply subtle vignettes to 
                            background images and separate sections with 
                            monochromatic content blocks, creating a layered 
                            effect that is visually interesting while maintaining 
                            an intuitive user experience.

                            The finished project is a four-page, fully 
                            responsive website designed for laptops, tablets, 
                            and mobile devices. It highlights my understanding 
                            of color theory, thoughtful font pairing, intuitive 
                            UI/UX decisions, and practical front-end development 
                            capabilities.

                            The website is now live and serves as MellowStruck's 
                            main platform for showcasing his music and connecting 
                            with new clients. Its clean layout makes it easy to 
                            explore his tracks, learn about his work, and access 
                            his social links. He actively uses it as his central 
                            hub for collaborators, listeners, and industry contacts.
