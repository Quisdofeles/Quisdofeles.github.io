                                Hello! My name is Robert Book. I am a graphic designer, 
                                illustrator, and web designer who focuses on clear, 
                                well-structured design across digital and print media. 
                                My work includes website design, layout design, illustration, 
                                print design and branding, with an emphasis on 
                                intentional choices and clean execution. I enjoy 
                                turning ideas into visuals that are easy to understand 
                                and built to last.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have worked with clients to design logos, websites, 
                                and marketing materials, managing projects from early 
                                concepts through final delivery. Through freelance and 
                                independent work, I've developed strong communication,
                                organization, and time-management skills while working 
                                within deadlines.

                            <p>
                                Designed a clean black-and-white logo for <b>MellowStruck</b> 
                                by merging the letters M and S into a single bold mark. 
                                The style pulls from EDM and lofi aesthetics, mixing 
                                hard geometry with subtle rounded details so it feels 
                                sharp but not sterile.The logo was built to scale cleanly 
                                across digital and print uses, making it flexible enough 
                                for everything from album covers to social media.

                                illustration, branding, layout design, motion graphics, 
                                and print design. I can help with everything from 
                                concept development to final production, adapting my 
                                approach to fit the scope and needs of each project. 
                                If you're looking for a designer who pays attention to 
                                details and cares about how work is built and presented, 
                                I'd be glad to work with you.
