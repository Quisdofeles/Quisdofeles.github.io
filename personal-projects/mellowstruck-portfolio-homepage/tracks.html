                        The song “You” is a super fun, energetic song that I 
                        had the pleasure to work on with two of my good friends 
                        Kevin Ferreira and Hunter Ward. It is a Pop/Synth Pop 
                        song with catchy melodies and vocal hooks!
                    </p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>
                        This is the second song I worked on with Hunter Ward, 
                        so to start off, I asked for the different vibes/genres 
                        that Hunter would love to work in, and after I did that, 
                        I opened up the project and started adding in different 
                        synth sounds that I felt would match the fun catchy pop 
                        direction that we chose. I layered different synth 
                        melodies and pads to create a fun, full color palette 
                        for the song. From there, adding guitars, catchy vocals, 
                        bass, and fxs, we ended with a song that is still one 
                        of our favorites that we all worked on.

                        I showcase my high-quality production skills as well 
                        as my mixing and mastering skills in this song. 
                        I also was able to showcase my melody creation/layering 
                        as well as my synth production in this song.

                        The song “Here I Lie” is one of my favorite songs I 
                        collaborated on. I got to work on this one with my 
                        good friend Kevin Ferreira. It is a Cinematic Acoustic 
                        song with story-like moments and a beautifully crafted 
                        build up at the end of the song.
                    </p>

                        This song was created with syncing to TV/film in mind, 
                        specifically a series finale or a big twist in a show.
                        We didn't know exactly where the song would be taken, 
                        but we got in the studio, recorded the main guitar 
                        progression, and from there, we could tell we were 
                        getting into that emotional, sorrow feel. Once the vocals
                        and bass were added, we could tell 
                        we were getting into that strange dystopian, cinematic 
                        universe. I layered different toy-like sounds 
                        with synths and Kevin's vocal layers to create this 
                        cinematic world you fall into when listening to this 
                        song.

                        I showcase my high-quality vocal production and 
                        production skills as well as my mixing and mastering 
                        skills in this song. I also showcase my cinematic 
                        building production, creating this world with sound 
                        that you're able to transported to when listening to 
                        this song. And lastly, I showcase my cinematic vocal 
                        production, creating vocal melodies and layers to help 
                        drive the song to its fullest potential.

                        Acidic Downpour is a chaotic, energy-driven soundtrack 
                        that I produced for a sync music library. It is a 
                        Cyberpunk, Acid track with high energy and fast paced, 
                        action packed drops.

                        This track was a blast to produce. It was created for
                        a sync music library, with the vibe of a fight 
                        scene/car chase in mind. I absolutely loved the 
                        production process for this track. I just opened the 
                        project and started with that iconic acid baseline 
                        that's heard throughout the track, and from there I 
                        just started placing layers on layers to make the 
                        drops sound absolutely full and powerful. Layered 
                        different basses, pads, leads, and FXs, I ended with 
                        a modern style cyberpunk track that I love listening 
                        back to.

                        as well as my melody creation.

                        This energy packed track is one of my favorite 
                        remixes I have made. It is a remix of the song 
                        “Too Late” from an amazing artist and friend, 
                        Isaac Mather. It is an EDM Hype track with energy 
                        driven sections and pumping drops.

                        When Isaac approached me with the idea for this remix, 
                        he was thinking energetic and hype. I took the ideas 
                        and stems he gave me and started layering synths and 
                        guitars with different melodies from the original song, 
                        and from there, created the intro, verses, and drops 
                        of this remix. As I created the track, I would 
                        continually show him the progress, and in the end, the
                        track ended up as a hype EDM remix.

                        Arachnid's Dance is a fun action track that I made for 
                        a indie 8-bit video game. The track is used in the boss 
                        battle fight. It is an 8-bit Chiptune track with retro 
                        vibes and 8-bit driven energy.

                    <p>
                        This track was a lot of fun to make! It was my first 
                        time working with any type of video game which was a 
                        lot of fun. They showed me different concept arts plus 
                        their direction for the game and the boss fight. They 
                        wanted the track to be built into 3 stages of intensity, 
                        growing more intense with each stage. After some back 
                        and forth with ideas, we ended with this track you hear 
                        now. I loved putting together my different 8-bit 
                        instruments and layers to create this modern, full 
                        sounding chiptune track.

                        The song “Come Back” is an edgy, dark song that I got 
                        to work on with my friend Kevin Ferreira. It is a Dark 
                        Pop, Cinematic song with tense atmospheres and dark 
                        production.

                    <p>
                        This song was a fun collaboration with Kevin. We wanted
                        to really grasp a certain cinematic vibe similar to 
                        Arcane, Billie Eilish, and Twenty-one Pilots. 
                        This is another song that is now placed in a sync music 
                        library. For the production, we started with just a 
                        piano to get some melodies and vocal melody inspiration. 
                        From there, we started building this hybrid drop that 
                        uses distorted basses and weird synths on top of Lo-Fi 
                        chill drums and foley percussion. We ended up with a 
                        modern, dark song.

                        Street Lights is a tension building soundtrack that I 
                        made for a sync music library. It is a Cinematic 
                        Electronic Soundscape track that is suspenseful and has 
                        a beautiful created build throughout the track.

                    <p>
                        This track was a very cool track to create. I used 
                        different layering techniques to create a clean build 
                        that stayed dynamic and interesting throughout the 
                        track. From the different bass pulses and driving 
                        staccato strings, to the energetic drums and massive 
                        electric guitars, this track displays a vast variety 
                        of different sounds and instruments. The track builds 
                        into a drop, then slowly dies away, ending as a fully 
                        dynamic soundtrack.

                        This song was such a fun collaboration to work on. 
                        It was made for a YouTube video I created 
                        (<a href="https://youtu.be/xNovcyt_uUQ">www.YouTube.com</a>). 
                        We started with just messing around the instruments we had, 
                        which were a piano, guitar, and ukulele. From there, we 
                        found a chord progression we liked and recorded the guitar 
                        and ukulele. From there, I started getting a vision of 
                        the song in my head and had Hunter record a vocal melody 
                        that I later turned into a high pitched vocal that became the 
                        foundation of the song. From there, the song was 
                        built up into a fun, catchy pop song.

                        This track was part of a cinematic album I created for 
                        a music brand. They were looking for music that sounded 
                        elegant and intelligent. I used many different sound 
                        design techniques to create different ambient synths and 
                        textures to create a soundscape that gives space and 
                        emotion to the track. This track has 3 section structure: 
                        an ambient soundscape, an energy driven section, and 
                        then the final climax, merging the soundscape and energy

                        through my use of layering orchestral percussion with 
                        modern sound design.

                        Paths We Cross is an analog horror-like soundtrack that 
                        I composed. It is a Hybrid Cyberpunk Liminal track with 
                        pulsing basses and weird analog synth elements.

                    <p>
                        This track is one of my favorite instrumental tracks I 
                        have produced. I made it for a YouTube video that I 
                        created 
                        (<a href="https://youtu.be/Ow5fIt1wXXY">www.YouTube.com</a>). 
                        This track is a 
                        fully dynamic track that is split in a few different 
                        sections including a calm yet strange intro, a 
                        chaotically weird build, a driving bass drop, and a 
                        climax with layers of synths and liminal sounds. 
                        I had a blast making this track that ended up as a 
                        liminal story-driven soundtrack.

                        also showcase my analog/liminal production skills 
                        through my use of analog synth production and liminal 
                        melody creation.
